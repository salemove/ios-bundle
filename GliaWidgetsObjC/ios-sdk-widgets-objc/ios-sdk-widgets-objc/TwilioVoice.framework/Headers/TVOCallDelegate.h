 *
 * @discussion The trigger conditions for the warnings defined in the `<TVOCallQualityWarning>` enumeration are defined as follows:
 *
 * - `TVOCallQualityWarningHighRtt` - Round Trip Time (RTT) > 400 ms for 3 out of last 5 samples.
 * - `TVOCallQualityWarningHighJitter` - Jitter > 30 ms for 3 out of last 5 samples.
 * - `TVOCallQualityWarningHighPacketsLostFraction` - Raised when average packet loss > 3% in last 7 samples. Cleared when average packet loss <= 1% in last 7 samples.
 * - `TVOCallQualityWarningLowMos` - Mean Opinion Score (MOS) < 3.5 for 3 out of last 5 samples.
 * - `TVOCallQualityWarningConstantAudioInputLevel` - Raised when the standard deviation of audio input levels for last 10 samples is less than or equals 1% of the maximum possible audio input level (32767) i.e. 327.67 and the call is not in the muted state. Cleared when the standard deviation of audio input levels for last 10 samples is greater than 3% of the maximum possible audio input level.
 *
 * The two sets will help the delegate find out what warnings have changed since the last callback was received.
